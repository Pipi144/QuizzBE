## Key Features

- **User Account Management**: Secure user authentication and account handling.
- **Role-Based Authorization**: Fine-grained access control, allowing only admins to manage sensitive operations like user editing and quiz management.
- **CRUD for Questions**: Create, read, update, and delete quiz questions seamlessly.
- **CRUD for Quizzes**: Comprehensive quiz management, including adding and deleting quizzes.
- **Take Quiz and Scoring**: Enables users to take quizzes and receive scores upon completion.
- **Integration with Auth0**: Secure and robust authentication implemented using **Auth0** for managing user sessions and identity.

## Technologies Used

- **ASP.NET Core**: The backend framework used for building a high-performance web API.
- **Entity Framework Core**: For managing database interactions with ease.
- **PostgreSQL**: A robust and scalable database solution.
- **Auth0**: For secure user authentication and session management.
- **Azure App Service**: Scalable and reliable backend hosting.

## Why This Project Matters to Me

As a developer who is relatively new to **.NET Core**, I took on this project as a challenge to demonstrate my ability to learn and apply new technologies effectively. Here are some key aspects:

- **Self-Motivated Learning**: I independently learned **ASP.NET Core** and integrated advanced features like **Auth0 authentication** and **role-based access control**, showcasing my ability to adapt and grow.
- **3-Tier Architecture**: Designed the application using a clean 3-tier architecture (Presentation, Business Logic, Data Access layers) to ensure maintainability, scalability, and separation of concerns.
- **Attention to Detail**: Designed and implemented secure and scalable solutions, ensuring data integrity and protection.
- **End-to-End Ownership**: From database design using **PostgreSQL** to deployment on **Azure App Service**, I managed all aspects of the backend development lifecycle.
- **Practical Experience**: This project allowed me to simulate real-world backend scenarios, including secure user authentication, CRUD operations, and efficient API design, making me confident in handling similar challenges professionally.

This project serves as a testament to my dedication, quick learning capabilities, and ability to deliver quality solutions even as I step into new technical domains.
